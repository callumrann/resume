## Projects

### Tic-Tac-Toe Server
Developed a server and client application for playing Tic-Tac-Toe using Python.
* **Implemented TCP communication** for server-client interactions using the `socket` library.
* **Utilized multithreading** to handle multiple clients concurrently without blocking I/O using the `threading` library.
* **Integrated password hashing** with `bcrypt` to secure user data during registration.

### Inkball Recreation
Recreated the classic Windows Vista game *Inkball* using **Java** and **Processing**.
* **Utilized Gradle** for project build automation and dependency management.
* **Created Javadocs** for comprehensive documentation and used `JUnit` for unit testing.
* **Employed Jacoco** for test coverage analysis.
* **Customized level configurations through JSON files**, allowing easy modification of game levels and scoring rules.

### Basic Platformer (In Progress)
Developing a *2D platformer* using **Java** with a focus on clean **OOP design.**
* **Designed an extensible framework** by applying object-oriented programming principles.
* **Implemented physics** to simulate gravity, friction, and collision mechanics.
* **Followed real-world Git workflows**, such as branching and merging via pull requests.
* **Introduced documentation practices**, attempting to maintain clarity and scalability of the codebase.
